\section{Question 8}

\begin{question}
    Let $G$ be the abelian group with generators $x, y, z$ subject to the relations $2 x+y=0$ and $x-y+3 z=0$. Find a product of cyclic groups which is isomorphic to $G$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    Since $G$ is generated by $x,y,z$ and $G$ is abelian, then $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^3$. From the relations, we could say that $G \cong \mathbb{Z}^3/\langle (2,1,0),(1,-1,3) \rangle$. Since $G$ is abelian, then we know that it is a $\mathbb{Z}$-module, and since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a P.I.D., we can use the structure Theorem. Write the relations into matrix form, we have
    \begin{equation}
        A = \left[
        \begin{matrix}
            2 & 1 & 0\\
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 0
        \end{matrix}
        \right]
    \end{equation}
    such that $\im A = \langle (2,1,0),(1,-1,3) \rangle$. Using the column and row operations we can find the Smith Normal Form of $A$, and denote this form to be $A'$.
    \begin{equation}
        A' = \left[
        \begin{matrix}
            1 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & 3 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0
        \end{matrix}
        \right]
    \end{equation}
    More specifically, $A \sim A'$. Then 
    \begin{equation}
        G = \mathbb{Z}^3/\langle (2,1,0),(1,-1,3) \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}^3/\langle \im A'\rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}^3/\langle (1,0,0),(0,3,0),(0,0,0) \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}.
    \end{equation}
\end{answer}
