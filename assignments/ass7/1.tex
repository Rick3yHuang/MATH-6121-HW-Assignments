\section{Question 1}

\begin{question}
    Let $F$ be a field, and let $I$ be an ideal in the polynomial ring $F\left[x_1, \ldots, x_n\right]$ generated by a (possibly infinite) set $S$ of polynomials. Prove that a finite subset of the polynomials in $S$ suffice to generate $I$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{proof}
        Since $F$ is a field, then $F[x_1]$ is a P.I.D., then $F[x_1]$ is a Noetherian ring. Hence, by the Hilbert Basis Theorem, we know that $F[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ is Noetherian. Hence, we know $I \subset F[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ is finitely generated. Suppose $S = \{f_1,f_2,\cdots\}$, we could construct a chain of ideals
        \begin{equation}
            (f_1) \subset (f_1,f_2) \subset (f_1,f_2,f_3) \subset \cdots
        \end{equation}
        Because $I$ is finitely generated, then we know that there exist $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the above chain stabilize to $(f_1,\cdots,f_k)$. Therefore, $(f_1,\cdots,f_k) = (f_1,f_2,\cdots) = I$. Because $\{x_1,\cdots,x_k\}$ is a subset of $S$, we proved our claim.
    \end{proof}
