\section{Question 7}

\begin{question}
    Let $R$ be a PID and let $p$ be a non-zero prime in $R$.
\end{question}

\subsection{Part a}

\begin{question}
    Let $a$ be a nonzero element of $R$ and let $M=R /(a)$. Prove that $p^{k-1} M / p^k M$ is isomorphic to $R /(p)$ if $k \leq n$ and to 0 if $k>n$, where $n$ is the power of $p$ dividing $a$ in $R$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part b}

\begin{question}
    Suppose $M_1$ and $M_2$ are isomorphic finitely generated torsion $R$-modules. Prove that, for every $k \geq 0, M_1$ and $M_2$ have the same number of elementary divisors $p^{\ell}$ with $\ell \geq k$. Prove that this implies $M_1$ and $M_2$ have the same set of elementary divisors.
