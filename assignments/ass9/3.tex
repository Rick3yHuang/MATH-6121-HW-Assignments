\section{Question 3}

\begin{question}
    Let $R=\mathbf{Z}[x]$ and let $M=(2, x)$ be the ideal generated by 2 and $x$, considered as a submodule of $R$. Show that the rank of $M$ is 1 but that $M$ is not free of rank 1 .
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $m_1,m_2 \in M$ and both nonzero, then if we let $r_1 = m_2$ and $r_2 = -m_1$, since $m_1,m_2 \in M \subseteq R$, then $r_1,r_2 \in R$. Notice that $r_1m_1+r_2m_2 = m_2m_1-m_1m_2 = m_1m_2-m_1m_20$ since $M$ and $R$ are both commutative. thus, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are not linearly independent. Thus, $M$ has rank $1$ since a single element is automatically a linearly independent set.
        
        Assume by contradiction that $M = \langle f(x) \rangle$. If $f(x)$ is a constant function, then $x \in M$ but $x \notin \langle f(x) \rangle$. If $\deg f(x) \geq 1$, then $2 \in M$ but $2 \notin \langle f(x) \rangle$. This leads to a contradiction. Hence $M$ must have a generating set of size at least $2$, so that $M$ is not free of rank $1$.
